( 57 ) ABSTRACT
Systems , methods , and processor readable media for dis
tributing digital data and electrical power to a plurality of
devices over high - impedance cables are disclosed. Certain
embodiments include a gateway device connected to a
power source , a first device connected to the gateway device
by a cable , the cable being a high - impedance cable having
at least two conductive paths , and wherein the first device
receives electrical power and digital data from the gateway
device via the cable over the same conductive path of the
cable , a second device connected to the gateway device by
the cable wherein the second device receives power and
